# streamable.js

Node.JS client to interact with the `streamable.com` API

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Not compatible with browsers** because they restrict the access to the `Set-Cookie` request header, which is vital for the client to keep the user logged in, since it contains the session cookies.

## Install

```
npm install github:madkarmaa/streamable.js
```

### Docs coming soon...
